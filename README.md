# Passboard Coding Challenge
### Take-home assignment for Backend candidates

## Requirements ⚡
We'd like you to build a simplified version of our Passboard platform, allowing users to explore public events and purchase tickets to attend these events.

This project aims to be a straightforward application achievable within a few hours.

## Product Features ⚡
1. Explore events available.
2. Purchase event tickets.
3. Apply promo codes for discounts on orders.

## Boundary Conditions ⚡
Certain boundary conditions must be met by the service:
- An event is visible only during its start and end date.
- Each event must have at least one ticket type.
- Ticket types have specific quantities.
- Promo codes are valid for one or more events and have a limited usage count for all purchases.

## Out Of Scope ⚡
To keep the scope manageable, there's no need to create UI, handle security, or set up a database. Feel free to utilize an in-memory database or any suitable data structure.

## Tasks ⚡
Your task is to build **REST APIs** to meet these requirements:

### Task 1 👩‍💻
